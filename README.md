# Scholarly-Satire
A curated collection of witty and satirical peer-reviewed papers that parody the conventions of academic research. These humorous works cleverly exaggerate or lampoon scholarly norms, providing a lighthearted take on everything from complex jargon to over-the-top methodologies, as well as the quirky and sometimes absurd aspects of academic life itself.

I've added my favorites in a folder labeled "Interesting Academic Studies"
